# ðŸŽ¶ Harmonize â€“ Concert Buddy Finder ðŸŽ¶

Harmonize is a social music app designed to help university students and young adults meet concert buddies.  
Think of it as a mix between **Hinge** and **Spotify** â€“ we connect you with people who share your music taste and want to attend the same concerts.  

Built with **Expo (React Native)**, **Supabase**, **Spotify API**, and **Songkick API**.  



## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js (v18 or later) installed.  
If you donâ€™t already have Expo, install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/harmonize-app.git
   cd harmonize-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Expo app:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   You can now open the app and run it locally in the Expo Go App (scan the QR code)
